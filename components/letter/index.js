        From the day we started in June 2010 until now, June 2017, Blue Sky
        Academy has gone through an unforgettable 7-year journey. All school
        levels, including Kindergarten, Primary and Secondary schools, have seen
        numerous opportunities and challenges and gained great achievements
        along the way. <br />
        We feel very fortunate for the chance to recall such moments in this
        yearbook. Each page is a celebration of teachers and students, of the
        rst generation of BSA. Blue Sky Academy is a dream school for all staff
        , teachers, and parents. <br />
        But, most importantly, it is a limitless blue sky where students can let
        their dreams y, freely play while learning, learn while playing,
        discover their aptitudes, and develop their talents. Blue Sky Academy o
        ers a unique, integrated curriculum, perfectly combining the programme
        of Vietnamâ€™s Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) with the world
        renowned programme Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). Some key
        guidelines for our education program are as follows: Let students at all
        levels explore the world around them. From Primary school, students are
        encouraged to ask questions and carry out their own research before
        arriving to class. Learn by asking questions, searching for answers and
        writing down the results.

        Embrace a hollistic development, both physical and cognitive, of the
        body and the mind. Shape student characters in the teaching and learning
        of every school subject, allowing them to grow in all qualities: moral,
        intellectual, aesthetic and physical. Ensure students know their mother
        tongue, so they understand their motherland and the Vietnamese people.
        And, from an early age, teach every student English as a second language
        so they can gain access to global knowledge. Increase practical learning
        of any subject through the use and application of science and
        information technology. Participate in all extracurricular, outdoor and
        social activities in order to foster personality development. Teachers
        and students never stop improving their own communications skills and
        through the activities inside and outside the classroom, they strengthen
        the bond among themselves. Blue Sky Academy will continue to post
        information about development plans, achievements on the school website
        (www.bsa.edu.vn), so parents and visitors can stay up to date on our
        progress. We are delighted to welcome all parents, teachers and staff as
        an inseparable part in the development of the Blue Sky Academy.
